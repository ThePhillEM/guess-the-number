Guess the Number - Java Mini Game
About the Project
This is a simple Java console game created as part of my learning journey into programming.
The goal of the game is straightforward: the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess what it is. After making a guess, the program informs the player whether they guessed correctly, reveals the actual number, and shows how far off the guess was by calculating the difference.

Additionally, the player can choose to find out whether the difference between their guess and the secret number is odd or even, making the game a little bit more interactive.

How It Works
When you start the game, you will be asked to enter a number between 1 and 100.
The program then compares your input to a randomly generated number and immediately displays whether you guessed correctly.
Regardless of the outcome, it also shows the numeric difference between your guess and the target number.
Finally, if you want, you can ask the program to tell you whether the difference is odd or even.

It's a simple, fun project that practices basic programming skills like random number generation, user input handling, conditional logic, and simple math operations.

Getting Started
If you would like to run this project on your own machine, simply follow these steps:

Make sure you have Java installed.

Compile the program using:


javac Main.java
Run the compiled program with:


java Main
Everything happens in the console, so no additional setup is necessary.

Future Ideas
While this project is intentionally simple, there are a few improvements Iâ€™m considering for the future:

Allow multiple guessing attempts instead of just one.

Give hints to the player whether their guess is too high or too low.

Add a scoring system that tracks performance.


These improvements would make the game more engaging and would be a great exercise in object-oriented programming principles.
